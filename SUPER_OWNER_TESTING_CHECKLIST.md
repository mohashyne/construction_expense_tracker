## 🚨 Known Issues to Watch For

1. If any link gives a `PermissionDenied` error, the user permissions may need adjustment
2. If templates are missing, you'll see `TemplateDoesNotExist` errors
3. If views are missing, you'll see `NoReverseMatch` or `AttributeError` errors

## 📱 Mobile Testing

Make sure to test on different screen sizes:
- Desktop (>1200px)
- Tablet (768px - 1199px) 
- Mobile (<768px)

Check that:
- Sidebar collapses properly on mobile
- Content doesn't overflow horizontally
- Buttons and forms are properly sized
- Text remains readable
